# EDA Results for Google Books Dataset

This folder contains the complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) results for the Google Books dataset.

## Contents

### Main Report
- **EDA_Report.md**: Comprehensive analysis report with findings, visualizations, and recommendations

### Folders
- **figures/**: 21 publication-ready visualizations (PNG format, 300 DPI)
- **scripts/**: 6 Python scripts used for analysis and visualization generation

## Analysis Scripts

1. `01_initial_exploration.py`: Initial data loading and structure inspection
2. `02_comprehensive_analysis.py`: Statistical summaries and data quality checks
3. `03_visualizations_distributions.py`: Distribution plots for all key variables
4. `04_relationship_analysis.py`: Correlation and relationship visualizations
5. `05_specific_patterns.py`: Investigation of specific patterns and anomalies
6. `06_ratings_investigation.py`: Deep dive into the ratings correlation paradox

## Key Findings Summary

- **Dataset**: 15,147 books from Google Books API across 100 search categories
- **Languages**: 97.8% English, high concentration in recent publications (2012-2021)
- **Missing Data**: Severe rating sparsity (94.3% unrated), moderate missing data for publisher/ISBN (~50%)
- **Pricing**: Only 17% buyable; technical books cost 10-20x more than consumer books
- **Notable Pattern**: Negative correlation between ratings count and average rating (driven by regression to mean)

## How to Reproduce

All scripts use the Python environment at `~/ml_env`. To rerun any analysis:

```bash
source ~/ml_env/bin/activate
python /path/to/script.py
```

Scripts are self-contained and will regenerate all figures in the `figures/` directory.

DATASET: Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present.parquet
RECORDS: 1,004,991 crime incidents (Jan 2020 - May 2025)
COLUMNS: 28 fields covering temporal, classification, victim, location, weapon

================================================================================
KEY DELIVERABLES
================================================================================

1. EDA_Report.md - Comprehensive markdown report with insights and recommendations
2. figures/ - 25 publication-ready visualizations
3. scripts/ - 6 Python analysis scripts (fully reproducible)
4. summary_stats.txt - Detailed statistical summary

================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. DATA QUALITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
   - 26.8% of records have victim age = 0 (placeholder for unknown)
   - 12:00 noon shows extreme spike (35,200 crimes) - likely default time entry
   - 24-27% unknown values for victim demographics
   - Negative ages present (137 records)

2. CRIME PATTERNS:
   - Property crimes dominate (62.8% of all crimes)
   - Top 7 crime types account for 50% of all incidents
   - Vehicle-related crimes represent ~22% of all crimes
   - Arrest rate is only 9.0% overall

3. TEMPORAL TRENDS:
   - Crime increased 2020-2022 (possibly pandemic-related)
   - Friday has highest count but only 11% above lowest day
   - Evening hours (18:00-23:00) show elevated violent crime

4. GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION:
   - Central LAPD area has 2.1x crimes of lowest area
   - 26% of crimes occur on streets
   - Good geocoding (99.78% have valid coordinates)

================================================================================
ANALYSIS APPROACH
================================================================================

- Distribution analysis for all continuous and categorical variables
- Time series decomposition (yearly, monthly, weekly, hourly)
- Geographic visualization (scatter plots, heatmaps)
- Cross-tabulation of crime types with time, location, demographics
- Concentration analysis (Pareto-style curves)
- Arrest rate calculation by crime type
- Default/placeholder value detection and quantification

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DATA USERS
================================================================================

1. EXCLUDE or FLAG records with:
   - Age = 0 for demographic analysis
   - Time = 12:00 for precise temporal analysis
   - Incomplete years (2024, 2025) for trend analysis

2. APPLY transformations:
   - Age groups instead of continuous age
   - Time periods instead of exact hours
   - Crime categories (Violent/Property/Other)

3. CONSIDER population adjustment:
   - Current counts reflect absolute numbers, not per-capita rates
   - Link to census data for area-level analysis

4. INVESTIGATE further:
   - Why is noon peak so extreme?
   - What explains low arrest rates for property crimes?
   - Are geographic patterns driven by population or crime rate differences?

================================================================================
TECHNICAL NOTES
================================================================================

- All analysis performed in Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- All visualizations use consistent styling and color schemes
- Grid lines, axis labels, and titles optimized for readability
- No log-scale histograms (transformed data instead per best practices)
- All file paths are absolute for reproducibility
